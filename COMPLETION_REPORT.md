## 🚀 Next Steps

### To Publish to GitHub

The code is committed locally but needs to be pushed. Choose one option:

**Option 1: Use Git with Personal Access Token**
```bash
# Set up authentication (one-time)
git config credential.helper store

# Push (will prompt for username and PAT)
git push origin main
```

**Option 2: Use SSH (Recommended)**
```bash
# Change remote to SSH
git remote set-url origin git@github.com:jufjuf/vibescan.git

# Push
git push origin main
```

**Option 3: Use GitHub CLI**
```bash
# Install gh CLI first
brew install gh

# Authenticate
gh auth login

# Push
git push origin main
```

### After Pushing to GitHub

1. **Test GitHub Actions** (5 minutes)
   - Create a test branch
   - Make a small change
   - Open a pull request
   - Verify workflow runs and adds PR comment

2. **Fix Dashboard Tailwind** (10 minutes)
   ```bash
   cd dashboard
   npm install @tailwindcss/postcss
   # Update postcss.config.js
   npm run dev  # Test it works
   ```

3. **Create Release** (5 minutes)
   ```bash
   git tag -a v1.0.0 -m "Initial release with auto-fix and GitHub Actions"
   git push origin v1.0.0
   ```

4. **Publish to npm** (Optional)
   ```bash

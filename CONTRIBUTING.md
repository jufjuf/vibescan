## üìù Coding Guidelines

### Vibe Coding Principles

- **Speed over perfection initially** - Ship fast, iterate based on feedback
- **AI-assisted development welcome** - Use Claude Code, Cursor, Copilot, etc.
- **Test-driven refinement** - Add tests for all new features
- **Keep functions small** - Max 30 lines per function
- **Self-documenting code** - Clear names > comments

### Code Style

- TypeScript with strict mode
- ESLint + Prettier for formatting
- Functional programming patterns preferred
- Async/await over callbacks
- Clear error handling

### Testing

- Write tests for all new features
- Maintain 80%+ code coverage
- Test edge cases and error conditions
- Use descriptive test names

### Commit Messages

Follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/):

- `feat:` - New feature
- `fix:` - Bug fix
- `docs:` - Documentation changes
- `test:` - Adding or updating tests
- `refactor:` - Code refactoring
- `perf:` - Performance improvements
- `chore:` - Maintenance tasks

Examples:
```
feat: add ReDoS pattern detection
fix: handle empty files gracefully
docs: update installation instructions
test: add tests for SQL injection detection
```

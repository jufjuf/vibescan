## Brand Identity Highlights

### Color Strategy

**Why Not Blue?**
Blue is oversaturated in developer tools (GitHub, VS Code, Azure DevOps, Docker). We differentiated with:

**Primary: Brand Teal (#14B8A6)**
- Modern, tech-forward
- Stands out from competitors
- Works beautifully in dark mode
- Represents precision and intelligence

**Accent: Electric Coral (#F97316)**
- Energetic, friendly
- Creates visual interest
- Balances the cool teal
- Perfect for CTAs and highlights

**AI Purple (#8B5CF6)**
- Represents AI/intelligence
- Used for AI feature badges
- Adds premium feel

### Typography Strategy

**Inter** (Headings & UI)
- Modern geometric sans-serif
- Excellent screen readability
- Professional without being cold

**JetBrains Mono** (Code)
- Developer-favorite
- Excellent character differentiation
- Ligature support for code operators

### Logo Design Rationale

The "Pulse Wave Scanner" logo represents:
1. **Vibe**: Wave/frequency visualization (left wave ascending)
2. **Scan**: Analysis beam (gradient line through center)
3. **Detection**: Focal point (orange circle at apex)
4. **Precision**: Clean geometric construction

This avoids generic shield/security iconography used by competitors.
